Supercache is a totally unobtrusive addon that runs along your Rails application rapidly improving your development time by caching ActiveRecord Queries across requests (unlike ActiveRecord QueryCache which happens only within a single request). This is especially helpful when your local database is located elsewhere and avoids costly DNS lookups for each and every query.

## Installation

Add this line to your application’s Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'supercache', group: :development
```

And mount the dashboard in your `config/routes.rb`:

```ruby
mount Supercache::Engine, at: "supercache"
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).

Bug reports and pull requests are welcome on GitHub at https://github.com/bragboy/supercache. This project is intended to be a safe, welcoming space for collaboration, and contributors are expected to adhere to the [Contributor Covenant](http://contributor-covenant.org) code of conduct.

### Running the tests

We're using the
[appraisal](https://github.com/thoughtbot/appraisal) gem to run our test
suite against multiple versions of Rails. Type `rake -T` for a complete list of
available tasks.

The RSpec test suite can be run with `rake`, or
`rake appraisal:rails4.0` to include Rails-specific specs.
